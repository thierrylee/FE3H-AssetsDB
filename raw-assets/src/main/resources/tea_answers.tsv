It upsets Hubert when I spend time alone with you. I’ll refrain from telling him about this.	Nod, Laugh	Edelgard
If I hadn’t been born to House Hresvelg, I imagine life would have been much simpler.	Laugh, Praise	Edelgard
You’re much more meticulous than I would have guessed.	Nod, Disagree, Blush	Edelgard
A moment of relaxation… It has been a while. I find spending these quiet moments with you rather comforting.	Sip tea, Blush	Edelgard
Do you remember the day we met? You protected me from those bandits.	Nod, Blush	Edelgard
You’re always so calm.	Disagree, Sigh, Sip tea	Edelgard
One day, I’ll show you around the palace in Enbarr. It has a lovely garden.	Nod	Edelgard
Here I can take a break from the burden of being emperor. Perhaps that’s why I’m so comfortable with you.	Nod, Laugh, Blush	Edelgard
I have no intention of handing the Imperial throne over to any child I might have. Instead, I’ll choose an outsider who’s brilliant and kind.	Commend, Chat, Praise	Edelgard
While I am quite busy, this is not a waste of my time. I’m grateful for the opportunity to observe you.	Sigh, Sip tea	Hubert
The head of House Vestra has always been a minister to the emperor.	Commend, Praise	Hubert
Lady Edelgard has taken a liking to you. She will want to hear all about this.	Nod, Disagree	Hubert
Most who spend time around me seem to become bored and depressed. Heh. Can’t imagine why.	Disagree, Admonish, Praise	Hubert
Sometimes your insights are so keen they seem to border on precognition.	Disagree, Sip tea	Hubert
House Vestra is one of few noble houses not to lay claim to any territory.	Commend, Chat	Hubert
As a humble servant to Her Majesty, I sometimes envy the status she has given you.	Disagree, Chat, Praise	Hubert
For choosing to walk this path with Her Majesty, you have my eternal gratitude.	Nod, Blush	Hubert
Sometimes I like to imagine that you were sent to us by a rival of the goddess to bring her low.	Chat, Blush	Hubert
You have a way of making people feel comfortable. I almost cannot help telling you everything.	Disagree, Blush	Ferdinand
Since I was a child, I have loved riding horses and fighting. People used to tell me to act more like a noble.	Laugh, Commend	Ferdinand
You often hear stories of nobles and commoners in love. I am not against such things, but reality is not so simple.	Nod, Commend, Chat	Ferdinand
When I am unhappy, I try to bestow happiness upon others. Such is the way of the true noble.	Sigh, Chat, Praise	Ferdinand
You treat everyone the same, regardless of status. Perhaps I should do that as well.	Commend, Blush, Praise	Ferdinand
I am extremely versatile. In fact, I fear I am a jack-of-all-trades.	Laugh, Disagree, Praise	Ferdinand
I suppose the Sword of the Creator never goes dull, so you do not need to sharpen it.	Nod, Chat	Ferdinand
You will always remember me, will you not?	Sip tea, Blush	Ferdinand
Hmm. It can be good to relax now and then. Shall we play a game?	Nod, Laugh	Ferdinand
You are full of mysteries and yet offer no answers. How unfair.	Disagree, Chat	Linhardt
Being surrounded by all these Crest-bearers makes me want to better understand Crestology.	Nod, Praise	Linhardt
Crest versus nurture. Which causes a noble’s personality disorder? There’s a research project, eh?	Chat	Linhardt
I always feel as if I cannot keep up with other people. Everyone else seems to have a destination in mind.	Laugh, Praise	Linhardt
Please wake me if I fall asleep. I don’t wish to be a rude guest.	Admonish, Sip tea	Linhardt
They say the Crest’s power dwells in blood. So why does it have to be so disgusting?	Admonish, Chat	Linhardt
If I don’t become a scholar then perhaps librarian is the job for me.	Nod, Praise	Linhardt
You bear the legendary Crest of Flames. You simply must allow me to study it–please, Professor.	Commend	Linhardt
We should explore ways to utilize the power of Relics and Crests for something other than combat.	Nod, Commend, Chat	Linhardt
Hey, are you getting hungry?	Laugh, Sigh	Caspar
I’m gonna keep training until I can beat you!	Disagree, Blush	Caspar
I just wanna go wild and let it all out! Come on, Professor, send me out front in our next battle!	Admonish, Chat	Caspar
I usually don’t get hung up on things, but when I do, I feel stuck!	Praise	Caspar
What is justice really? I’m not so sure I know anymore…	Commend, Chat	Caspar
Who was that guy? You don’t know who I’m talking about? The suspicious guy who killed himself!	Nod, Chat	Caspar
They say hard work pays off, but I don’t think that’s always true. Either way, I’m gonna keep trying!	Commend, Praise	Caspar
I really love fighting alongside you. I can always count on your commands to get us through!	Nod, Laugh, Blush	Caspar
I’m always gonna do things my way. If there’s a wall blocking my path, I’ll punch a hole right through it!	Laugh, Commend, Praise	Caspar
My mother works in the Imperial capital. People there say she’s a genius.	Laugh, Commend	Bernadetta
Please don’t eavesdrop on my singing anymore, OK?	Nod, Praise	Bernadetta
I was worried you called me here to punish me for something. I’m glad I was wrong.	Admonish	Bernadetta
If two people decide to be recluses together…does that even still count?	Laugh, Chat	Bernadetta
I like to hide out in the greenhouse, but I always have to leave eventually. No place to sleep.	Nod	Bernadetta
It’s relaxing here! Should’ve brought my sewing kit.	Nod	Bernadetta
You’re spoiling me. I don’t want to go out on my own anymore.	Admonish, Praise	Bernadetta
My room at the monastery is my home away from home, but this is cozy too.	Laugh, Disagree, Admonish	Bernadetta
The room feels a little…empty. Needs more cuteness.	Laugh, Admonish	Bernadetta
More nobles than you’d expect make a pilgrimage to Garreg Mach to pray.	Commend	Dorothea
I am not really a fan of hymns. I don’t want to offer silly songs to my goddess.	Sigh, Chat	Dorothea
My ideal partner is religious, but only just. And they have enough money to live on for all our days.	Blush, Praise	Dorothea
So, you don’t have any weaknesses after all? I’m totally envious of you.	Disagree, Sip tea	Dorothea
You’re such an open-minded person, Professor. I’m glad you don’t judge me for living how I want to.	Laugh, Sip tea, Blush	Dorothea
Why are men so vain? They should know their lies will never last.	Laugh, Chat, Sip tea	Dorothea
Don’t you think you feel stronger attraction to someone when you know you may die tomorrow?	Nod, Chat	Dorothea
So many people have died… I’m so terribly down. I feel better here, with you though.	Nod, Praise	Dorothea
Whatever the future may bring, I’m so glad I met you.	Blush	Dorothea
If you are having problems, I am happy to be listening.	Chat	Petra
The ocean is far from Garreg Mach… I am feeling a bit lonely at times.	Sigh, Praise	Petra
Next I will be studying, training, researching, sparring… I am having a lot to do!	Admonish, Praise	Petra
You are working with much…diligence. I am admiring of you.	Laugh, Disagree	Petra
You are not remembering where your homeland is? I am thinking that is strange…	Sigh, Chat	Petra
One day I am wanting to show you the wonderful land of Brigid and its abundant nature.	Nod, Blush	Petra
It gives me great pleasure to be speaking with you like this.	Sip tea, Blush	Petra
In Enbarr, I was a hostage. I was spending much time locked away. Books gave me great comfort.	Sigh,Praise	Petra
I am requiring much sleep to be staying alert. At least a quarter of each day.	Laugh, Admonish	Petra
Please join me for training when you have the time. There is much I could learn from you.	Nod, Disagree, Blush	Dimitri
I cannot tell you how long it has been since I indulged in a nice, relaxing conversation…	Laugh, Sip tea	Dimitri
I apologize for troubling you. I am grateful for your support.	Nod, Blush	Dimitri
Perhaps because of my strength, I have always been rather clumsy. I always end up breaking things that are precious…	Chat, Praise	Dimitri
When I feel down, I go out for a long ride on my own. There is no place more relaxing than a trusted steed’s back.	Nod	Dimitri
I do my training, and then care for my swords and spears…and then the day is over before I know it.	Nod, Laugh	Dimitri
You really helped me. More than I can say. If it weren’t for you, I do not know where I would be now…	Disagree, Blush, Praise	Dimitri
I would invite you to my quarters next, but I fear my space is so bare it is almost laughable.	Laugh, Disagree	Dimitri
These last five years, I have been many places, and I have seen many things.	Chat, Praise	Dimitri
Was there something you wanted to discuss?	Nod, Sip tea, Blush	Dedue
I do not like classrooms. I would rather learn at my own pace.	Disagree, ¨Praise	Dedue
I am the sword and shield of His Highness. I must constantly work to improve.	Commend, Praise	Dedue
Should I have brought sweets?	Nod, DIsagree	Dedue

Next time, you should visit me. I will prepare tea and cake.	Nod, Blush	Dedue
Long ago, I once held a grudge against the blood of Duscur. Now, I… Well, it is not important.	Chat, Praise	Dedue
Crests, lineage, knighthood… Trifles. Skill and survival are the only things that matter.	Nod, Commend, Chat	Felix
You intrigue me. What made you so strong?	Chat, Blush	Felix
I’m glad I was born into a family of soldiers. I’ve been wielding a sword for as long as I can remember.	Commend	Felix
I know it’s important to take a break, but if you rest too long, your muscles wither.	Nod, Chat	Felix
Some people like to snack when they take a break. No willpower.	Nod, Sip tea	Felix
Spending time with you is…not bad.	Laugh, Blush	Felix
Join me for sword training again. I want to know my victory isn’t a fluke.	Nod, Commend	Felix
I’m always thinking about wars, but this room feels so peaceful.	Laugh	Felix
Well…I appreciate all that you do for me.	Laugh, Blush	Felix
I still have a lot to learn. I need to work harder.	Disagree, Praise	Ashe
Have you ever seen a ghost? Probably for the best if you haven’t…	Disagree, Sip tea	Ashe
I’m good with children. I’ve taken care of my younger siblings since I was a kid.	Laugh, Commend	Ashe
It’s nice in here. I feel like I can relax.	Laugh, Sip tea	Ashe

You’re always really stoic.	Chat, Sip tea	Sylvain

When I’m with you…I feel like I can be myself.	Laugh, Blush	Annette
As a child, my father and brother used to yell at me for spending so much time with my horse.	Laugh, Admonish	Ingrid
I’m already thinking of my next meal…	Laugh	Ingrid
It’s warm around the monastery and the soil is rich… Honestly, I’m envious.	Chat, Praise	Ingrid

You’re not like the others. You’re an outsider, just like me.	Nod, Chat	Claude
There are too many mysteries in this world. I wonder how many we can solve in our lifetime…	Nod, Praise	Claude
I’ll take you to my hometown one day. There are some truly tasty dishes you can’t find in Fodlan.	Nod, Laugh	Claude
By the way, they’ve discovered a new kind of poison mushroom. When you eat it, your body exudes a mysterious steam! Um, or so I hear…	Laugh, Commend	Claude
You’ve become quite expressive, haven’t you? You weren’t like that when we first met.	Nod, Laugh, Blush	Claude
A noble’s life is full of rigid expectation. I sometimes envy the freedom of commoners.	Disagree, Praise	Lorenz

I gotta become a proper knight so I can take care of my little sis!	Commend, Praise	Raphael

I can’t miss a single lecture if I wanna become a proper knight!	Nod, Chat, Praise	Raphael
My grandpa used to be real strong when he was younger. I obviously take after the guy!	Laugh, Commend	Raphael
You’re pretty strong for being so shrimpy. You’d be unstoppable if you put on some muscle!	Laugh, Disagree, Blush	Raphael
Wanna train together? I can show you some new techniques I thought up!	Nod, Sip tea	Raphael
I wouldn’t have come here if my parents were still alive. That means I never woulda met you!	Nod, Sigh	Raphael
You seem tired, Professor. The best cure for sleepiness is sleep!	Laugh, Disagree	Raphael
I wanna support my family, but I don’t know if I can handle being a knight.	Nod, Praise	Ignatz

I need to keep training. I know a brush and canvas aren’t enough to protect you.	Chat, Blush, Praise	Ignatz
I know I could stand to lighten up from time to time.	Admonish, Chat, Praise	Lysithea
One of the few pleasures I find is in eating sweets. It’s…kind of embarrassing.	Nod, Laugh	Lysithea
Do you believe in ghosts, Professor? Just wondering.	Laugh, Chat	Lysithea
If I hadn’t met you, I don’t think I’d be who I am today.	Laugh, Disagree	Lysithea
It’s not in me to put energy into things that won’t yield results. I just don’t see the point.	Admonish, Chat	Lysithea
Talking to you feels worth my time. I feel there’s a lot I can learn from you.	Laugh, Blush	Lysithea
I wonder what I’d do, who I’d be, if I gave everything up for freedom. I think about that all the time.	Nod, Chat	Lysithea
If not for Crests, the world might’ve been a more peaceful place.	Sigh, Chat, Praise	Lysithea
I’m exhausted by all my incessant thoughts. I just want to empty my mind for now.	Nod, Laugh, Sip tea	Lysithea
Spending time with me must be boring, isn’t it?	Disagree, Admonish	Marianne

It’s not like I can go home… My adoptive father doesn’t want me there…	Chat, Praise	Marianne
Thanks to you, I’m beginning to feel more comfortable talking to people.	Nod, Disagree	Marianne
I’m all right now. I think I can look forward to living my life.	Nod, Laugh, Commend	Marianne
I hope you never leave…oh! Never mind… Ignore me.	Laugh, Blush	Marianne
You know? I love hearing myself talk!	Nod, Sip tea	Hilda
Have you ever cried, Professor? It’s hard to imagine you crying.	Sip tea	Hilda
You don’t say much, so you’re easy to talk to.	Laugh, Admonish	Hilda
My mind keeps drifting today…	Nod, Laugh	Hilda
No matter what happens in this crazy world, I know I’ll be safe if I stay by your side.	Nod, Chat	Hilda

We should go on a trip together someday, when it’s peaceful.	Nod, Laugh, Blush	Hilda
Your room’s so neat! You should clean mine too.	Nod, Disagree	Hilda
I wish I could stay here and chat all day. Time to go back to the real world though.	Laugh, Praise	Hilda
Hope you’ve been keeping up with your training. If you’re not careful, I’ll surpass you.	Nod, Commend	Leonie
I don’t care what you think of me. I just don’t want to lose to you.	Commend, Admonish	Leonie
Don’t throw away anything that’s still usable, OK? I’ll take whatever you don’t need.	Nod, Commend	Leonie
Back home, I always trained alone. No one else in my village wanted to be a mercenary.	Nod, Sigh, Praise	Leonie
I’m proud to be the greatest apprentice to the best mercenary in Fodlan. That keeps me going.	Nod, Praise	Leonie
I feel bad acting out so much around you. Seems like I just can’t help it.	Laugh, Disagree, Chat	Leonie
I’ll always be here for you. Just like I promised Captain Jeralt.	Nod, Laugh	Leonie
Don’t worry about what I owe to my village. I don’t live this frugally for nothing.	Nod, Commend, Praise	Leonie
People always seem to be talking about romance, but…honestly, I’m just not interested in that stuff.	Commend, Chat, Praise	Leonie
I wonder why the archbishop is so interested in you.	Chat, Sip tea	Seteth
I do hope you will inform me of any issues you may encounter in the monastery.	Nod	Seteth
I know I speak harshly at times, but I hope you understand that I am merely doing my job.	Nod, Sigh	Seteth
You have become very special to us.	Nod, Chat	Seteth
The more you learn about yourself, the more paths will become open to you.	Nod, Chat	Seteth
If there is anything I can do for you, please tell me.	Nod, Laugh, Blush	Seteth
When my own thoughts grow tiresome, I go fishing. You should join me sometime.	Nod, Laugh	Seteth
Whatever happens, know I am proud to support you.	Chat, Blush	Seteth
I put up a stiff front with people, due to my position. But that’s not really me.	Nod, Laugh, Blush	Seteth
Lively places are my favorite. I like the monastery because there are always so many people bustling about.	Nod	Flayn
I desire to see the ocean again–it is difficult being so far away from it	Nod, Chat	Flayn
You are an interesting person, Professor. You do not seem to know much about yourself.	Nod, Disagree	Flayn
Have you any idea how many types of fish there are? It is unthinkable–their different sizes, shapes, colors… I find it fascinating!	Commend	Flayn
Whenever I look at you, a wave of nostalgia washes over me. I wonder why that is.	Laugh, Sip tea	Flayn
I have a fear of sleeping. I worry that I will awake, and everyone I know and love will have vanished.	Disagree, Praise	Flayn
I was born in Enbarr, though I have lived in remote lands far away, at times…	Nod	Flayn
You and I are of a rare breed. We should take care of each other.	Nod	Flayn
Even if I fall asleep, please do not leave my side. Promise you will stay near.	Nod, Laugh, Blush	Flayn
The “Ashen Demon.” What an unbelievable title, knowing who you are now…	Disagree, Sip tea	Hanneman
Since I have never found out the secret of your birth, I am exceptionally intrigued.	Chat, Blush	Hanneman
Why don’t you come by later? I’d very much like to dive into some research together.	Commend, Sip tea	Hanneman
The Crest of Flames shares many traits with other Crests. Yet, it also has many unique characteristics.	Nod, Chat	Hanneman
It was my own choice to leave behind my noble title and holdings. I’ll not be going back.	Commend, Praise	Hanneman
The monastery holds so many documents in its library, yet certain facts continue to elude me.	Commend, Chat, Praise	Hanneman
All of my hard work, my unrelenting study of Crests, is all in the name of my sister, rest her soul.	Sigh, Praise	Hanneman
I never can stop talking about Crests, can I? Don’t you dare laugh at me.	Laugh, Admonish	Hanneman
Can’t be helped. I’ll tell you about my favorite food again. Or perhaps we should talk about drinks?	Laugh, Admonish, Sip tea	Hanneman
There’s no alcohol in here. It’s better if you can sleep without it, but… All you have is tea?	Admonish, Sip tea	Manuela
Am I that terrible of a woman? So, I’m a little unkempt, what of it?	Disagree, Admonish	Manuela
Who are you really? Such a mystery. I don’t really understand you… Tell me everything.	Sigh, Chat	Manuela
What should I do to find love, Professor? I don’t want to spend my days alone.	Chat, Praise	Manuela
You think I complain too much, don’t you? I know I do, but I can’t help it.	Disagree, Praise	Manuela
Sometimes I think back to when I used to shine as a songstress.	Nod, Sip tea	Manuela
I must thank you for spending so much time with me. Your company helps me keep sane.	Laugh, Praise	Manuela
Your room is so nice and clean. How do you keep it like this?	Disagree, Chat	Manuela
You are always so kind to me, Professor. I love it, but that, too, is its own vice, isn’t it?	Sip tea, Blush	Manuela
Walking first thing in the morning is a pleasant way to begin your day. Try it sometime.	Nod	Gilbert
I enjoy a bit of fishing. I hear you do as well?	Nod	Gilbert
Spear, sword, archery, martial arts, soldiery… I believe I’ve mastered most things worth mastering.	Nod	Gilbert
I’ve served the royal family for decades, and marched through history by their side.	Nod, Sigh	Gilbert
I am an unforgivable sinner. I do not deserve a peaceful life.	Disagree, Praise	Gilbert
No judge, not even the goddess herself, will bring me to justice. Though I deserve it.	Sigh, Praise	Gilbert
It’s true that strength alone will not make you powerful. Yet you will not become powerful without it.	Chat	Gilbert
The Holy Kingdom of Faerghus is the nation of proud knights. I love that country… and miss it deeply.	Nod	Gilbert
I am sorry, but relaxing is…not a skill I possess.	Laugh, Praise	Gilbert
You don’t look much like Captain Jeralt, but you remind me of him.	Nod, Commend, Disagree	Alois
There’s nothing worse than trying to explain a joke.	Commend	Alois
Ghosts, sailing, spicy foods… These are the fears I have yet to conquer.	Laugh	Alois
You should go fishing with me soon! The other day, I almost caught one.	Laugh, Chat, Praise	Alois
Don’t forget, if you ever need anything, just let me know.	Nod, Praise	Alois
I’ve been prattling on and on about myself. How are you today?	Nod, Chat	Alois

When the war’s over, I can finally go home to my wife and daughter…	Nod, Praise	Alois
I hear your nickname is “Ashen Demon.” It’s good, but not as good as “Thunder Catherine.”	Disagree, Sip tea, Blush	Catherine
I’m always watching you. I guess this is your way of returning the favor.	Nod, Sigh	Catherine
You know war strategy, not just how to wield a sword. Maybe I should study that too.	Admonish, Sip tea	Catherine
I’m not going to hurt you. No need to look so nervous.	Sigh, Sip tea	Catherine
I’m a little restless. I don’t much care for waiting around.	Disagree, Chat	Catherine
You look calm, as usual. I wonder what you look like when you’re nervous.	Admonish, Sip tea, Blush	Catherine
I have zero desire to go back to Faerghus. Can you imagine me as a noble?	Nod, Laugh	Catherine
We should train together.	Laugh, Sip tea	Catherine
You and I both have sword Relics. We should spar with them soon.	Nod, Commend, Praise	Catherine
I’m not much for conversation. I’ll gladly leave if you’re bored.	Disagree	Shamir
Heh. You always have an interesting look on your face.	Disagree, Sip tea, Blush	Shamir
The Sword of the Creator… It’s an interesting Relic.	Nod, Chat	Shamir

I enjoy a lack of conversation. But how are you?	Nod, Sip tea	Shamir
I look forward to the next battle. They seem to go smoothly under your command.	Nod, Blush	Shamir
I apologize for what I said before. It was tactless to compare you to memories from my past.	Disagree, Sigh	Shamir
This room… It suits you.	Nod, Blush	Shamir
Dagda is far. It would take months to travel there by foot…	Admonish, Chat, Praise	Shamir
Lady Rhea sure seems to like you, Professor. I don’t know why…	Nod, Sip tea	Cyril
If I got kicked out of the monastery, I’d have no other place to go.	Commend, Disagree, Praise	Cyril
I like working. Feels real good to be needed.	Commend, Praise	Cyril
